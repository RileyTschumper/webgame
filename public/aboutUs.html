	  		<p>I am a junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of St. Thomas. I have interned at Thomson Reuters as a software engineer and I plan to work there is upcoming summer. I love computer science because it forces me to be efficient and creative when problem solving. The skills I have learned from it are applicable for many aspects of life.

	  		<p> In my free time, I work with Dr. Scott Yilek on research. I also participate in PULSE, a dance club on campus, and computer science club. My hobbies include watching Game of Thrones, exercising, eating at new restaurants, and hanging out with my sister (who is a freshman at UST).</p>
